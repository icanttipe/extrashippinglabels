2) **Grant of Patent License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) **Grant of Source Code License.** The term "Source Code" means the preferred form for making modifications to the Original Work and Derivative Works. The Original Work and Derivative Works may be distributed in Source Code form and/or object code form.

No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) **External Deployment.** The Licensor grants You the right to deploy the Original Work and Derivative Works externally, for example, as a service provided over a network, without being required to distribute the Source Code of the Original Work or Derivative Works to the users of such service.

6) **Attribution Notices.** You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the Original Work. In addition, You must include a notice in any Derivative Work that clearly states that it is a Derivative Work and identifies the Original Work.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) **Limitation of Liability.** UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE ORIGINAL WORK INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

9) **Acceptance and Termination.** If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) **Patent Action Termination.** This License terminates automatically and immediately if You institute patent litigation against Licensor or any contributor to the Original Work (including any party from whom Licensor has obtained a sublicense to the Original Work) alleging that the Original Work or a Derivative Work infringes a patent owned or controlled by You.

11) **Jurisdiction.** This License shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, excluding its conflict of law provisions.

12) **Attorneys' Fees.** In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action.
